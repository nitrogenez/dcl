== Types

* Primitive
** integer: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, accepted characters: `0` to `9`
** unsigned integer: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, accepted characters: `0` to `9`
** floating point: `f32`, `f64`, accepted characters: `0` to `9`, `.`
* Complex
** string: `str`, accepted characters: all
** section: `section`, accepted characters: `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, `_`, exclude: `0` to `9` if X is first character

== Tokens

* `identifier`
* `str_literal`
* `num_literal`
* `punctuator`

=== Tokens:identifier

The `identifier` token can be one of the following:

* `var_name`
* `section_name`
* `type_notation`

Rules:

* Disallow use of numeric characters as first character of the `identifier`
* Allow use of numeric characters as any other character of the `identifier`
* Disallow use of special characters (charset: `@#$%^&(){}[]<>\/`)
* Disallow use of punctuation characters (charset: `,.;:?!`)
* Disallow use of math operation characters (charset: `-=+`)

=== Tokens:str_literal

The `str_literal` token represents a quoted string literal.

Rules:

* Disallow use of the quote character unless escaped
* Allow use of singular quote character

=== Tokens:num_literal

The `num_literal` token represents a numeric literal, which is most likely a number.
`num_literal` might be the following:

* `float_literal`
* `int_literal`

Rules:

* Allow use of all numeric characters (charset: `0123456789`)
* Allow use of the underscore character (`_`), omitting it later

==== Tokens:num_literal:formats

The `num_literal` can be in one of the following representations:

* `binary` (charset: `01`, prefix: `0b`, `0B`)
* `hexadecimal` (charset: `0123456789ABCDEFabcdef`, prefix: `0x`, `0X`)
* `octal` (charset: `01234567`, prefix: `0o`, `0O`)
* `decimal` (charset: `0123456789`, prefix: none)

`num_literal` must be parsed as `decimal` by default. The user may decide to use
another representation, for that the user must prefix the `num_literal` with one of the 
prefixes listed above.

=== Tokens:punctuator

The `punctuator` token corresponds to any punctuation character.
Charset: `.,?!;:`
